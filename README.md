# Java Programming Solving Problems with Software

This course is offered at Coursera and is part of the [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming).

This is the second course of the Specialization, [Link to the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming).

**Notice:** Some code should be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. The IDE from the University website is [here](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2).
